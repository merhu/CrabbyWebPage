    <!-- list of ingredients --->
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 lb. jumbo lump or backfin crab meat </li>
        <li> 2 slices bread or bread crumbs </li>
        <li> 1 tbsp. mayonnaise (light or regular)</li>
        <li> 1 tbsp. Dijon mustard </li>
        <li> 2 tsp. Old Bay seasoning </li>
        <li> 1 tbsp. snipped parsley </li>
        <li>1 egg (or substitute for special diets) </li>
        <li>tartar sauce or cocktail sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- directions -->
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>  -  Beat the egg in a bowl. Trim the crusts from the bread and break the slices into small pieces. 
         <br> -  Add these pieces to the egg. Mix in the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, Chesapeake seasoning and parsley, and beat well. 
         <br> - Place the crabmeat in a bowl and pour the egg mixture over the top. Gently toss or fold the ingredients together, taking care not to break up the lumps of crabmeat.
         <br> -  Form the cakes by hand into patties about 3 inches around and 3/4-inch thick. Shape should be like a cookie, not like a meatball or golf ball. 
         <br> - Place the cakes in the refrigerator for at least 45 minutes before cooking. This is very important so the cakes don't fall apart.</p>
    <h3> Broil the Crab Cakes: </h3>
        <p> - Slip them under a preheated broiler until nicely browned, turning to cook evenly, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side.</p>
    <h3> Or Saute: </h3> 
        <p>- Heat a small amount of butter or olive oil in a skillet and saute the cakes, turning several times, until golden brown or about 8 minutes total cooking time.
         <br> - Serve at once with tartar sauce, mustard, or cocktail sauce on the side.</p>
